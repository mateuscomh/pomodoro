# Introduction

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management technique developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It is based on the idea of breaking work into 25-minute intervals, called pomodoros, separated by regular breaks. The technique is widely used to increase productivity and personal efficiency.
How does the technique work?

The Pomodoro Technique is easy to understand and implement. To get started, follow these steps:

    Choose the task you want to accomplish.
    Set a timer for 25 minutes.
    Work on the task until the timer rings.
    Take a 5-minute break.
    Repeat steps 2-4 three times.
    Take a longer break of 20 to 30 minutes.

Repeat this cycle until you complete the task.

The Pomodoro Technique helps to avoid procrastination and maintain focus while working on tasks. The regular breaks help to avoid mental fatigue and increase creativity and motivation.
